## Introduction
Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word. 

## Research
In learning foreign language such as English, a learner should have motivation in order to have willingness to learn. This project is an attempt to investigate the students’ motivation in learning English by using Hangman Game. And this study was to find out if the use of Hangman game motivates the students in learning English. The method used in this study was quantitative with experimental research design. The target population of this study was the eighth grade students of MTs Negeri Cirebon 1.

## Defining Our System
Motivation
A major problem in education is
lack of motivation. Students often exert
the minimum rather than maximum
effort (Meece and McColskey, 2001).
Students with low motivation definitely
learn the material with a little effort.
While the students with high motivation
will learn something with their big effort.
And their effort to learn will give an
influnce for their achievement.
One of the main tasks of the
teacher is to make their students
interested in the subject, even though the
students do not have an interest in it
Previous Study
To do this research the writer
looked for some previous study as a
guide for this research. The first previous
study tells that teacher can use game
such as Make a Sentence, Unscramble
Sentences on the Board, Hangman and
Word Hunt to help their students in their
communication skills and teacher is
responsible for creating a constructive
classroom atmosphere, which encourages
vocabulary expansion. And it is because
student prefer learning by using
educational games rather than traditional
activity based lesson. Also, ESL/EFL
specialists often justified that the use of
games with reference to the motivation,
they can provide for the students (Pisheh
and Bagheri, 2012). It means that
student’s communication skills can be
helped by using game. And it can also
create a good atmosphere in the
classroom
